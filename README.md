## Projects

---
## 1. HR Analytics & Attrition Prediction (Capstone Project)

**Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  


**Description**:  
- Explored HR dataset (15,000 employees) to identify drivers of employee attrition.  
- Conducted EDA: attrition strongly linked to **overwork**, **low satisfaction**, and **4-year tenure dips**.  
- Built predictive models: **Random Forest achieved 96% accuracy and 0.94 AUC**.  
- Delivered actionable recommendations for HR: cap project load, address burnout, and refine promotion/evaluation policies.
- 
###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Correlation Heatmap**  
Shows strong negative correlation between satisfaction and attrition, and positive correlations between project load, hours, and evaluations.

**Attrition Distribution**  
Compares employees who left vs. stayed across key groups.

###  Modeling & Results

**Logistic Regression – Confusion Matrix**  
Baseline model achieved ~82% accuracy.

**Decision Tree – Splits**  
Visualizing the splits shows project load and evaluation as key factors.
